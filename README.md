# Commander

![Commander](./Assets/CommanderWide.png)

A Roblox Studio plugin, providing a simple multi-line command bar, with support for undo and saving presets.
Does NOT (yet) support syntax highlighting.

Unfortunately, Commander is not available on the Creator Store as it has been moderated and multiple appeals have been denied. This is likely due to the plugin's usage of `loadstring`.
